/**
 * Type Inference
 * 
 * Type inference is a Java compiler's ability to look at each method invocation and corresponding 
 * declaration to determine the type argument (or arguments) that make the invocation applicable. 
 * The inference algorithm determines the types of the arguments and, if available, the type that 
 * the result is being assigned, or returned. Finally, the inference algorithm tries to find the 
 * most specific type that works with all of the arguments.
 *
 * Wildcards
 * 
 * In generic code, the question mark (?), called the wildcard, represents an unknown type. The wildcard 
 * can be used in a variety of situations: as the type of a parameter, field, or local variable; sometimes 
 * as a return type (though it is better programming practice to be more specific). The wildcard is never 
 * used as a type argument for a generic method invocation, a generic class instance creation, or a 
 * supertype.
 * 
 * Upper Bounded Wildcards
 * 
 * You can use an upper bounded wildcard to relax the restrictions on a variable. For example, say you want 
 * to write a method that works on List<Integer>, List<Double>, and List<Number>; you can achieve this by 
 * using an upper bounded wildcard.
 * 
 * To declare an upper-bounded wildcard, use the wildcard character ('?'), followed by the extends keyword, 
 * followed by its upper bound. Note that, in this context, extends is used in a general sense to mean either 
 * "extends" (as in classes) or "implements" (as in interfaces).
 * 
 * To write the method that works on lists of Number and the subtypes of Number, such as Integer, Double, and 
 * Float, you would specify List<? extends Number>. The term List<Number> is more restrictive than 
 * List<? extends Number> because the former matches a list of type Number only, whereas the latter matches a 
 * list of type Number or any of its subclasses.
 * 
 * Consider the following process method:
 * 
 * public static void process(List<? extends Foo> list) { // ...  }
 * 
 * The upper bounded wildcard, <? extends Foo>, where Foo is any type, matches Foo and any subtype of Foo. The 
 * process method can access the list elements as type Foo:
 * 
 * Unbounded Wildcards
 * 
 * The unbounded wildcard type is specified using the wildcard character (?), for example, List<?>. This is 
 * called a list of unknown type. There are two scenarios where an unbounded wildcard is a useful approach:
 * 
 * - If you are writing a method that can be implemented using functionality provided in the Object class.
 * - When the code is using methods in the generic class that don't depend on the type parameter. For example, 
 *   List.size or List.clear. In fact, Class<?> is so often used because most of the methods in Class<T> do not 
 *   depend on T.
 * 
 * Lower Bounded Wildcards
 * 
 * The Upper Bounded Wildcards section shows that an upper bounded wildcard restricts the unknown type to be a 
 * specific type or a subtype of that type and is represented using the extends keyword. In a similar way, a 
 * lower bounded wildcard restricts the unknown type to be a specific type or a super type of that type.
 * 
 * A lower bounded wildcard is expressed using the wildcard character ('?'), following by the super keyword, 
 * followed by its lower bound: <? super A>.
 * 
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Note: You can specify an upper bound for a wildcard, or you can specify a lower bound, but you cannot specify both.
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 
 * Say you want to write a method that puts Integer objects into a list. To maximize flexibility, you would like the 
 * method to work on List<Integer>, List<Number>, and List<Object> â€” anything that can hold Integer values.
 * 
 * To write the method that works on lists of Integer and the supertypes of Integer, such as Integer, Number, and 
 * Object, you would specify List<? super Integer>. The term List<Integer> is more restrictive than List<? super Integer> 
 * because the former matches a list of type Integer only, whereas the latter matches a list of any type that is a 
 * supertype of Integer.
