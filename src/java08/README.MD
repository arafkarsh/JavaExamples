# Java 8

The goal of this Project was to produce an open-source reference implementation of the Java SE 8 
Platform Specification defined by JSR 337 in the Java Community Process.

JDK 8 reached General Availability on 18 March 2014. Production-ready binary distributions based 
on the JDK 8 code base are available now from Oracle and will be available soon in most Linux 
distributions.

Development of JDK 8 Update Releases is being done in the nearby JDK 8 Updates Project.

## Content
JDK 8 was the second part of "Plan B". The single driving feature of the release was Project Lambda. 
(Project Jigsaw was initially proposed for this release but later dropped). Additional features proposed 
via the JEP Process were included so long as they fit into the overall schedule required for Lambda. 
Detailed information on the features included in the release can be found on the features page.
