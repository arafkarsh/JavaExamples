/**
 * SOLID Examples
 *
 * Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
 * High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on
 * abstractions (e.g., interfaces), not on concretions (e.g., classes).
 *
 * Handle all Bank Account related Activities
 *
 * The refactored Code has 1 Responsibility
 *      1. Deposit and Withdrawal
 *
 * Finally, DIP ensures that both high-level and low-level modules depend on abstractions.
 *  - Notification implementation is completely abstracted away.
 *  - Notification is loaded based on the Conditions defined in the Property File.
 *  - Check the BankNotificationConfiguration class for conditional loading.
