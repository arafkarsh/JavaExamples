/**
 * SOLID Principles
 *
 * Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
 * Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses
 * without affecting the correctness of the program.
 *
 * This means all the sub-classes of BankAccount Interface must implement the
 * following interfaces
 * 1. deposit()
 * 2. withdrawal()
 * 3. calculateInterest()
 *
 * The issue with above 3 methods available on Interface.
 * - All the implementing classes must have an implementation for all the 3 methods.
 * - If a Sub Class doesn’t need the deposit() method then it may throw an Exception
 *   saying no such method error. Which can cause problems in being consistent and will
 *   affect the following definition.
 *
 * Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses
 * without affecting the correctness of the program.
 *
 * Model with Issues
 *
 *
 *                                              |--------------------------------|
 *                                             |   BankAccountLegacyInterface  |
 *                                            |     - deposit()                      |
 *                                           |     - withdrawal()                 |
 *                                          |     - calculateInterest()         |
 *                                         |-------------------------------|
 *                                                           |
 *                 +-----------------------+-----------------+--------------------+
 *                 |                             |                       |                         |
 *           |----+--------------|    |----+----------|    |----+-------------|  |----+---------|
 *           |  Savings...Service  |    | Fixed...Service |   | Checking...Service |  | SIP...Service |
 *           |-------------------|    |---------------|   |------------------|   |--------------|
 *
 *   In the above accounts the recurring deposits happen only for the following types of accounts
 *   and allow multiple withdrawals (as well as deposits).
 *   1. Savings Account
 *   2. Checking Account
 *   3. SIP Account
 *
 *   While the FixedDeposit Account Type will have only multiple withdrawals after the account
 *   creation. So, when you invoke the deposit() method in Fixed Deposit it should throw an error.
 *   This is the actual issue which breaks the following rule:
 *   Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses
 *  without affecting the correctness of the program.
 *
 *  Solution
 *
 *             |----------------------------------|
 *            |  AbstractBankWithdrawalService  |
 *           |     - withdrawal()                    |
 *         |------------+---------------------|
 *                       |
 *                      +---------------------------------------+
 *                      |                                                |
 *                     |                         |------------------+-----------|
 *                    |                         |  AbstractBankDepositService   |
 *                   |                        |     - deposit()                      |
 *                  |                        |-------------------+------------|
 *                 |                                                 |
 *                |                                  +-----------+-----------+-------------------+
 *               |                                  |                              |                         |
