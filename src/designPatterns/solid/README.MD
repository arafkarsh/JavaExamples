# Java 23 SOLID Design Patterns and Code Refactoring

In this section, we'll explore how to refactor and modernize a legacy application using SOLID design 
principles as a foundation for transitioning towards a cloud-native, microservices-based architecture. 
This approach will ensure that the application is scalable, maintainable, and adaptable to modern 
cloud environments.

The SOLID principles are a set of five design guidelines in object-oriented programming that help 
developers write more maintainable, flexible, and scalable code. These principles were introduced 
by Robert Cecil Martin (Uncle Bob, born December 5, 1952) and aimed to improve software 
design and architecture.

## 1. S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Definition: A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one 
responsibility or job.
- Explanation: This principle focuses on keeping a class focused on a single task or behaviour. If a 
class has more than one responsibility, changes to one part of the class could affect other parts.

## 2. O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Definition: Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for 
modification.
- Explanation: You should be able to add new functionality without modifying existing code. This is 
usually achieved through abstraction and inheritance or using interfaces.

## 3. L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Definition: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without 
affecting the correctness of the program.
- Explanation: Subclasses should be able to stand in for their parent classes without causing errors 
or changes in behavior. This promotes the correct use of inheritance.

## 4. I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Definition: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
- Explanation: A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it doesn't need. Instead, smaller, 
more specific interfaces are preferred.

## 5. D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- Definition: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on 
abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
- Explanation: The idea is to reduce the coupling between high-level and low-level modules by 
introducing abstraction layers, such as interfaces or abstract classes, that both modules can depend on.

## Why SOLID Principles Matter:
- Maintainability: The code becomes easier to understand, modify, and extend without introducing bugs.
- Testability: Smaller, more focused classes and modules are easier to test in isolation.
- Scalability: When adhering to these principles, the architecture can grow and adapt to new features with less effort.
- Flexibility: Code becomes more modular, making it easier to swap or extend parts of the system without touching existing code.

Together, these principles encourage better software design by promoting loose coupling, high cohesion, 
and code reusability.
