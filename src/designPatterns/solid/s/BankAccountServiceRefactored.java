/**
 * SOLID Examples
 *
 * Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
 * A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one j
 * ob or responsibility.
 *
 * Handle all Bank Account related Activities
 *
 * The refactored Code has 1 Responsibility
 *      1. Deposit and Withdrawal
 *
 * The following responsibilities moved to respective classes
 *      2. Save Account Details
 *      3. Send Notification Details
 *
 * With Single Responsibility Pattern the Handling of Save Account Details
 * and sending Notification must be done in separate classes.
